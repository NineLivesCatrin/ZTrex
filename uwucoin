Online. Never has a word better described how we live today, than the word online. We do almost everything online nowadays, our shopping, our business, our socializing, all happen right here on the web. Here at floofuwu we embrace this online culture more than anything, after all: online is the future, and the future is now. Do you want to grab your future with us together, today? Or do you want to remain stuck in the past of yesterday?<br><br>
Here at floofuwu, we believe that the best solution, is often the one that is most fun. After all, when we are passionate about something, we can really put our heart and soul into our projects, whatever they may be. to truly make something that can be showed off and enjoyed by thousands, nay, millions, is a feeling truly unique, and a feeling that you can be a part of.

As the tech space ever expands, it grows evermore rigid, and stuck in its ways. How many times have you heard of a mysql breach, leaking account data of thousands of users? How about ddos attacks, shutting servers down for days because of poor server management? Here at floofuwu, we are not stuck in our ways, working with the same tools everyone uses. We forge our own destiny out of good, original code. After all, how many times have you heard of a datacat breach? That's right. Never.
<br><br>
'But', i hear you ask, 'What is it that you -do-?'. Well, for that we need to look no further than the following paragraph. We innovate. We create. We make something out of nothing, like The Lord Himself shaping the earth, only our earth is made out of numbers, and the life we breathe is inside electronic machines. Our team works on several interesting projects, like a brand new interactive web game, a light online hosting platform, a solution to create and seal memories online to share with loved ones, and the brand new database solution called Meowscript(Is the data in the box or outside of it? potential threats will never know!).
<br><br>
But it does not stop there, oh no! not only do we at floofuwu provide the greatest security and customer care in existence, we also innovate other fields like computer mathematics! You may have heard about hexadecimals, the advanced computer numbers that do all of the heavy lifting inside your CPU. Well floofuwu.com proudly presents; Flexadecimals! While normal hexadicimals only count to 15, Flexadecimals does it one better, and bends the laws of computer science itself, to count to 16 instead! Never before has computing be so fast!
<br><br>
Onwards to the coin itself. Uwucoin aims not to compete with other crypto currencies like bitcoin, troncoin, or whatevercoin else they come up with as a name. Uwucoin is different, in that it represents live shares in Floofuwu's capital. That's right, you can buy into Floofuwu directly, and as the company grows, so does the value of your coin. We as a company promise that 85% of all incoming revenue will be put back into the company, to make it grow even quicker. And as we grow, so will our creative potential and options to make those new ideas a reality!

'So where do i sign up?' I hear you asking, and for that, look no further than these next few words. You can make a floofuwu account right here, which comes with an uwucoin wallet and monitoring tools free of charge. Want more information? Don't hesitate to contact us at doreply@floofuwu.com.
